They are a small but promising startup with 4 full-time employees, led by the vision of CEO Dorian Ferlauto, a trained engineer whose goal is to expand and transform the company into a profitable multi-million dollar operation by 2019. BriteHub offers cloud-based software with a marketplace that helps pair vendors with manufacturers, customer relationship management, and project lifecycle management. Users are able to oversee their manufacturing projects and orders, from start to finish, from Request for Quote (RFQ) to Purchase Orders (PO) to final product delivery. Both manufacturers and product sellers are able to use the software to manage their day to day business. \n\nThe purpose of our 5-month long project with BriteHub has been to provide them with consulting advice in order to further develop, innovate, and clarify their business model. Our team consists of five DMBA students from the California College of Arts: Maria Chercoles, Rumaisa Mughal, Nick Brooks, Kaavya Krishnan, and Rebecca Luoh. Before arriving at our final conclusions, our research has included several in-person and teleconference interviews with Dorian and her team in Oakland, customer questionnaires, secondary competitor research and analysis, two in-class presentations with critiques, and plenty of Post-It notes. \n\nWhen we began our research with BriteHub, we learned that they had recently made the decision to pivot their business from being solely a vendor/manufacturer matchmaking service towards being a complete lifecycle software solutions company. This shift will continue to require a significant overhaul of the business model. Many aspects of their existing business model had still been largely ignored thus far, especially with regards to delivering customer value. With millions of dollars in private investment riding on the success of their small team, BriteHub definitely has their work cut out for them in order to handle this pivot smoothly while effectively managing their day-to-day office work. \n\nIn order to help BriteHub find success, our team has helped to reframe their plan of action.  We decided to provide Dorian and her team with four different business model canvases; the first canvas reflects the status quo of where BriteHub realistically is today, and the other three canvases provide Dorian and her team with aspirational visions of where the company could aim to position themselves in the upcoming years, while depicting distinct focuses on product innovation, customer relationship building, and infrastructure management. Additionally, along the way we collaborated with BriteHub to craft their first mission statement. It is our hope that these materials will deliver to BriteHub a clarified vision of their strategy and purpose while navigating this significant pivot in their value proposition.

These changes are causing people to explore new ways to reinvent themselves and adapt in order to find new stability within the job market, or compatibility within an entirely new professional context.  This process involves re-examining their values and answering some fundamental questions, including: who they are, what is important and meaningful to them, how they think about and create value, and what they want to do versus what they are capable of.  People are using a broad spectrum of tools, tactics, and coping mechanisms that span job hunting, entrepreneurship, networking, career coaching, self help, skills acquisition, education, and in extreme cases, counseling and medical treatment. \n\nWhen faced with a significant change in their job or career, most people shift a great deal of their attention to the future.  What do they want? What is really important to them?  In general, when formulating answers to these questions most people determine that they want to lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.  So they begin to envision a variety of possible futures – potential bright spots on their horizon -- that align with their values (e.g. who they want to be) and enable them to feel good about themselves, happy (or at least OK) with where they are now, and empowered about the changes, challenges, and adaptation they face. \n\nThese people are actively seeking ways to move towards a future they want and believe in – their preferred future. But in many cases, who they want to be and what they want to do (their preferred future) is not available to them because it is based on what they see as their “potential,’ NOT their existing capabilities or capacity.  As a result, more often than not, people do not possess the wherewithal (e.g. the skills, experience, actionable steps, relationships, resources etc. etc.) required to realize their potential, and manifest a preferred future.  Subsequently, they are forced to re-define themselves and their future based on what they have or have not done in their past. \n\nASPIRE is a solution that enables people in transition to live into their potential (not their past), and actualize a preferred future. ASPIRE enables people to connect and collaborate to co-create a more meaningful “today” that moves them towards a “tomorrow” they want and believe in. \n\n•	Helps people define and share a “preferred future” in a purposeful network environment\n•	Generates and preserves a navigable/actionable “possibility path” to a preferred future\n•	Enables a “citizenry” to connect, collaborate, and co-create along their possibility paths \n•	Enables people to earn and deliver specific value (verified skills, experience, and relationships acquired in the past) that helps others progress along their possibility path to their preferred future\n\n', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/08957ead-680e-4f05-a804-5933ade48c12/1/', '', 'Spring 2016', 'Foresight Venture Studio', 'Leland Shupp', 'SFMBA-608-01', NULL, 0),

Our online platform and dedicated elder care planners are available to families 24/7 so they can track, manage, and maximize both their and their elders’ health, finances, insurance policies, and legal documents.', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/fe5e1590-8431-44df-b18a-a8f2406f22cb/1/', 'Anthony Salazar, Elizabeth Kukka, Raphael Teixeira, Alex Shu', 'Spring 2016', 'Venture Studio', 'Michael Fox', 'DSMBA-608-01', NULL, 0),

Programs working to rehabilitate aren’t properly self-assessing and a majority lack fundraising capacity. They also have limited knowledge sharing and the ability to learn from others to redesign programs for scale and greater effectiveness. Funders have limited visibility into a program’s impact and as a result see social investments as risky. \n\nThe Opportunity\nBeyond Bars focuses at the system level of recidivism efforts to connect funders with service providers so funds are channelled to the most effective programs. This in turn motivates programs, as a whole, to adopt an approach which directly translates into sustainable funding, and therefore creates a steady downward trend in recidivism. Presently, no centralized database of the organizations working in social impact exists. Nor is there a shared platform of communication on which these Service Providers and potential Funders can connect. \n\nThe Market\nThe US Department of Justice requested 95.3 million for prevention and reentry efforts with $56.5 million being allocated to grants. More broadly giving by foundations amounted to $53.7 billion in 2013 and of that total amount 12% went to human services and grant making entities according to Giving USA. Open Society Foundations allocates 6% of their total 2016 of 930.7M budget towards Justice Reform and The Rule of Law programs. Beyond Bars estimates foundational giving to recidivism organizations at $386 million (6%*12%*53.7B) although the ability to demonstrate most effective correctional strategies through data remains undone. \n\nThe Concept\nBeyond Bars plans to be a for profit benefit corporation that incentivizes service providers to measure their impact by connecting them with foundations looking to fund programs making a difference. We expect to reach $8.8 million in annual revenue in year 5 by charging funders and programs an annual subscription fee to access impact data. After establishing this vertical, Beyond Bars plans to expand to other social problems where funders need impact measurements to drive accountability and transparency. By prompting and facilitating ongoing communication between Funders and ‘Top-Rated’ Service Providers, we can transform beyond a mere static database into a dynamic, evolving platform, through which the critical players channel available funds to organizations doing effective work in the recidivism space.

OR  If people talk more, will the airport be better?”\nwe developed two different strategies inside to connect people and improve the air traveler’s experience, thereby delivering these core meanings of wonder, community, and validation: the Social Pass (via the airline) and a Living Community Board (via the airport).\n\nSpark Pass\n\nThe Spark Pass will be a partnership between a specific airline (e.g. Virgin America) and the vendors within the airport terminal. Attached to the boarding pass, the Spark Pass offers exclusive deals within an airport terminal that rewards social interaction and making meaningful connections with other individuals. Travelers do not know the function of it, they are simply driven by curiosity. As a result, travelers benefit from a shared experience with a fellow traveler that attaches meaning to the airline, and Chili’s Too made potential revenue it may have otherwise never seen. As a result, the traveler’s experience was improved by the social interaction, the airline is seen as generous (and may not have to provide as much free food onboard), and the terminal vendor gained revenue. \n\n\nAirport Diaries\n\nSecond, the airport terminal has the opportunity to provide meaningful social interactions through the Living Community Board - Airport Diary. The installation creates the opportunity for travelers to say something interesting. We state the prompt and users follow. For example: “Prompt: I know the best places in San Francisco.” Passengers can confess their love for the Spice Girls, or state their pride in The Rolling Stones. Participants will be prompted to voice their ideas via a handwritten post or an audio clip they can record through the installation’s microphone. While the handwritten posts will serve as a banner to those passing by, the audio will provide another dimension to engage travelers and allow them to share their stories with others. Afterwards they get a sticker or another identifier, which they either wear or paste somewhere. When somebody else sees it, they could potentially be curious about it, and start a conversation with another traveler. \n\nThe Living Community Board engages travelers through sight, sound, and touch while providing the opportunity for travelers to pause and engage with the space and individuals around them on a common level. As a result, people benefit from a shared experience with a fellow traveler that attaches meaning to the airport and, arguably, the city it represents while increasing the social surface area of the terminal space. The terminal no longer has to serve solely as a functional space, but can also operate as a community common space.

Until recently, they were the biggest music streaming service in the United States with more than 80 million monthly active listeners. The service is available on the web and on a variety of mobile and automobile devices in the US, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nPandora has been making headlines with a recent series of strategic acquisitions, followed by a $300 million convertible debt offering. In May they acquired a social analytics company that focuses on the music industry called Next Big Sound, in October they acquired the online event ticket seller TicketFly, and in November they acquired Rdio, a streaming music service known as the “hipster” version of Spotify. This has caused much speculation on whether or not these moves will be enough to make Pandora successful as the music streaming industry only becomes more and more competitive.\n\nIn this presentation, I will analyze their financial statements in order to contextualize Pandora’s recent financial activity. I will use their Income Statement to analyze the structure of their business model and evaluate their performance over the past 3 years. Next I will look at their Balance Sheet to assess the overall health of the company. Then I will review their Cash Flow Statement to determine how long they can continue to operate with the amount of cash they have, in other words I will calculate their burn rate.

In 2013, Pandora had a significant runway for growth. As one of the few media companies operating at scale across multiple platforms, Pandora had been able to tap into both the $20B plus digital advertising market and had taken part in the $15B US radio business. \n\nIn 2014, Pandora delivered a strong financial and operational growth while establishing new initiatives\nreflecting our unique leadership position in the music industry. Also, Pandora uniquely positioned itself to capture growth from both the $20 billion plus US digital advertising market and the $15 billion plus US radio business as they continued to gain market share and expand meaningfully into local advertising markets that was oncedominated by terrestrial radio.  On the other hand the core innovations like Music Genome Project, Pandora’s User Experience, Comedy Genome Projects and Pandora’s Algorithms are all the highly invested projects at Pandora.   Studying the financials of this company i.e. tech based and depended on increasing the listener hours.  Possible challenges Pandora, on their ability to increase the number of their listeners and listener hours that will depend on effectively addressing a number of\nchallenges. I think some of them would be,  • providing listeners with a consistent high quality, user-friendly and personalised experience.\n• successfully penetrating the connected car and non-U.S. markets.\n• continuing to build catalogs of music and comedy content that their listeners enjoy.\n• continuing to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and their competitors.  Looking at the Music and Tech Industry and specifically the market I would say Pandora missed quite a lot of opportunities starting from the Music Genome Project, Pandora was the original Internet radio provider, and still is -- but its failure to jump into the on-demand market that''s now carrying growth in streaming may be its most glaring mistake. Still, there are others.\n\nUnlike Spotify or Apple Music, Pandora has failed to establish a foothold abroad. Spotify is now available in over 50 countries, and Apple Music is offered around the world, but Pandora is only streaming in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand.  While Europeans were clamouring for the service a few years back, negotiating deals over music rights in individual countries has proven too hairy for the company.  New Possibilities for Pandora, a key element of their strategy  should be to increase the number of listeners and listener hours to\nincrease our industry penetration, including the number of listener hours on mobile and other connected devices. \n  Looking at their current situation although, as their number of listener hours increase, the royalties they pay for content acquisition also would increase.  In addition, they have then adopted a strategy to invest in their operations in advance of, and to drive, future revenue growth.  In addition, they should continue to invest heavily in their operations to support anticipated future growth.  ', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/790828de-e685-4d4f-af7e-3931a6355270/1/', '', 'Fall 2015', 'Financial & Managerial Acct', 'Martin Low', 'DSMBA-612-03', NULL, 0),

I am currently a graduate student in the Design MBA program at California College of the Arts. I am going to walk you through a brief analysis of the Mazda Annual Report from 2013 – 2015. During this period, Mazda made a substantial shift that led to nearly a billion-dollar spike in net and operating income, all while maintaining their debt-to-equity, current, and quick ratios for a seemingly low-risk and overnight miracle, all thanks to innovation.\n\nI chose Mazda because one of my first cars in high school was a 2004 Mazda RX-8. I drove this car for 7 years before giving it up, and my next car will probably be a Mazda as well. If I were to work for a car company in design, Mazda would be high on my list. You see, Mazda has always taken pride in their individuality, avoiding the “cookie-cutter” image and serving the niche market of driving enthusiasts who desire affordable performance and efficiency in an attractive, fun to drive package. The Mazda heritage is known as the “Zoom-Zoom” way, and along with many other innovative solutions, Mazda is constantly surprising the industry with new ways to approach old problems. Those things I admire most about them. But how innovative are they? Mazda claims that their focus is on innovation, but our professor Marty Low taught us to always find the story in the numbers. Therefore, we will examine the statements and ratios for clues to evidence of their success in 2013, and we will also investigate the notion that there is a connection between sales performance and the investments made into research and development. As many of you may know, Mazda is a Japanese company based out in Hiroshima, Japan, so for reference, keep in mind that 120 Yen is equal to 1 USD. I will try to state my figures in US currency, ratios and percentages, even though the statement mostly shows Yen.\n\n\nAfter the analysis, the big question is such: would I consider Mazda the innovative powerhouse that it claims to be? Not as defined by most. The overhaul of the company certainly yielded great returns, and they were willing to follow through with aggressive marketing relative to their size. However, Mazda is not trying to be at the cutting edge of autonomous vehicles or alternative fuels. They are addressing those who are buying a car right now and want to have a blast during their commute each day.\n\nIn summary, Mazda separated from Ford by 2013, just in time to release an entirely redesigned fleet, and are selling dramatically more cars than before. They are certainly an underdog company that never ceases to amaze me. They keep their ears open to hear our concerns, and their sales strategy is to maintain all former Mazda drivers while developing vehicles that newcomers might enjoy as well. Their “Clean Slate” approach to design truly did create the success they have now, and I look forward to seeing the continued progress Mazda will make now that it is no longer persuaded by a different company. I hope you enjoyed my analysis of the Mazda Motor Corporation.

You feel the pain when you leave the lights on, take extra hot showers, or forget to fix a leak when your bill spikes as a result of your excesses. Even the people who claim to not care about sustainability feel the financial pressure to reduce their energy and water use. So why don’t we treat trash, recycling and compost waste the same way? If we want people to reduce their waste, we need to bring awareness and financial incentives and consequences, to our waste disposal system. We can no longer rely on the “toss it and forget it” model we are using today.\n\n     According to the The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, plastics amount to 13 percent of the municipal waste stream and unfortunately, only about 9 percent of plastics are recycled. The EPA also estimates that each American throws away 1.3 pounds of food waste every day and that these compostable items, along with yard waste, make up 20 to 30 percent of the U.S. waste stream! For a typical resident, there is no real incentive to properly sort trash, recycling and compost because the user pays the same every month no matter how full or empty each bin may be.\n\n     We know that the first step in any change in behavior is empowering the user with knowledge. Our prototype, TRASH TALK, is a “smart waste receptacle” that provides instant feedback to its user regarding the amount and type of waste the user has most recently deposited in the receptacle as well as cumulative data over time, through an on bin weight display and through an app. We also know that information is only the first step and that really behavioral change results from incentives and consequences. The information collected by the TRASH TALK trash can will be used by the municipal waste collection service in a “cap and scale” type system to calculate the monthly bill so that behavioral changes in purchasing and disposal has a real financial impact on the user and can work towards San Francisco’s goal of zero landfill contributions by 2020.\n\n     We see our plan rolling out in a series of stages, beginning as a pilot program working in close concert with the local municipality. A few neighborhoods would be selected to pilot the program and given the option to lower their monthly waste bill by reducing their waste production with the TRASH TALK cans. Garbage would incur the highest fee per pound by a significant margin, with recycling for a much lower fee per pound, and compost for a nominal fee per pound. Eventually the full program could be rolled out to correspond with a rate hike for customers who opt out of the TRASH TALK program and subsidized trash cans available to those who wish to participate. Over time, we anticipate that a more active engagement with waste will result in changes in the consumption habits of users, who will begin to demand compostable and recyclable packaging, or better yet, solutions that involve no packaging at all.\n', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/f4dd6e60-2503-4491-b9a4-8d062e566aac/1/', 'Jennifer Muhler, Andrew Greenwood, Lexy Guo, Alison Sarewitz, Cole Shiflett', 'Spring 2015', 'Sustainability Studio', 'Michael Sammet', 'DSMBA-604-1A', NULL, 0),

Sustainability at it’s best provides life enhancing ways and there’s no more apt topic to apply sustainability to than sexual health. Sustainable sexual health is not a phrase in our lexicon and for some justifiable reasons, it’s a highly individualized and the stakes are high. Through our research we focused on condoms as the primary method that men and women use together that prevents pregnancy and STDs. Worldwide there are over 10 billion condoms used annually, and even the most environmentally green person doesn’t purchase with the social impact in mind and disposes of them with hardly a thought of their impact. \n\n70% of the condom market is dominated by one brand, Trojan, but in our tireless review of other offerings we were able to find a glimmer of hope, L. Condoms. This condom met our principles of being sustainably produced (more pure latex which leads to improved biodegradability), sustainably packaging (recycled material and plant based ink), and lastly, and most importantly, a social mission built into their business model (1-for-1). We found the answer to our problem, an awesome sustainable condom, the challenge was how to make it better. \n\nThe biggest opportunity for L. is the access to a new channel of mass retail by launching at Target. With a 1-for-1 model, if they gained 5% of market share they would be able to provide condoms to sub-saharan countries most impacted by HIV/AIDS. With the potential to make impact around the world, we refreshed L.’s already sharp male-focused marketing to start the conversation of empowering women to “own it.” Women have more and more control in every aspect of their lives and sexual health is no exception. We’re targeting the women who wants freedom from being embarrassed about taking control of her sexual health. We will position L. to fit with the millennial do gooder woman who expects more, in every aspect of her life. Our second message will tie “own it” to the global impact. In our research we found that the millennial shopper expects brands to have a good-factor built in. This is why this message is second, it reinforces what consumers already want, a great brand doing great work. \n', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/09745f8c-6a4f-4050-93ba-fd6232c528ef/1/', 'Chris Ribaudo, Anne Steeves, Tony Gui (Zheng Quan Gui), Franziska Sessler, Ismar Mahmutovic, ', 'Spring 2015', 'Sustainability Studio', 'Michael Sammet', 'DSMBA-604-1B', NULL, 0),

The Reformation currently has a fantastic and well thought out fabric sourcing practice including the use of deadstock, non-toxic solvents, and reusing vintage garments. Beyond these highly considered practices, Reformation has become a success because of their desirable, bespoke, and high-quality clothing. Reformation has taken several initiatives to consider the conception and use of their clothing from cradle to sale. What Reformation has not yet accomplished, however, is closing the loop of their garment cycle, beyond the point of sale. We see a great opportunity to consider the end of life of Reformation garments by adding a new point of contact from customers to company. In doing so, the company will not only develop additional interactions with their customers, but will also create a new channel of material sourcing, and incentivize additional sales.\n\nOur team will create a second key touch point between Reformation and their customer. We call this touch point “Collection”, as part of a broader "One of a Kind Collection" initiative. Starting with the brick and mortar Reformation stores in Los Angeles and New York City, customer can bring in their used clothes in exchange for a 15% discount on their next purchase.\n\nThe items will be categorized in three ways:\n\nReFresh- these items are next to new, and will be spruced up with cleaning and other minor adjustments (such as new buttons, or minor stitch repair). They will rejoin the current cycle of vintage clothing that already makes its way onto the shelves of the retailer.\n\nReNew- these items are in need of a bit more attention, and will receive alterations, damage repair (holes or abrasions), and style adjustments (such as sleeve removal, skirt shortening, etc.). This will occur in a way that aligns with Reformations existing vintage clothing approach.\n\nReImagine- These items may either have too little fabric to work with, or have damage that prevents resale. In this case Reformation will fold these items back into their deadstock fabric sourcing channel, to create accessories, scarves, or other reimagined items with the fabric of the garment.\n\nReformation staff will have a checklist to quickly decide if the clothes are high-quality enough to fulfill which and any of these three categories. If items are up to standards, they will be sent to Reformation’s factory in Los Angeles to be absorbed within their current vintage re-appropriation division. If the clothes are beyond repair, Reformation will pass the garments to one of their currently existing scrap fabric partners (local schools and a few nonprofits). These systems are already in place, and the introduction of the “collection” phase will not only close the loop but elegantly compliment the existing operations of Reformation.

', 'There exists a lack of conscientiousness of how our hydration habits affect the environment. Single plastic bottle use is the preferred form of hydration. Because plastic bottles represent a significant pollution source to the environment and are unsustainable in their manufacturing, seeking to reduce their use is of prime importance. In order to reduce their use, targeting smaller cultures, such as campuses, both academic and corporate, is a good place to start to create subcultures that then may permeate the larger culture and create significant change in the way people choose to hydrate.\n\nFor this project, the campus in San Francisco, at California College of the Arts, will serve as a case study where we aim to reduce water bottle consumption by 60% of the student population and create a framework for other campuses to adopt similar strategies. The main goal is to create subcultures that then permeate the larger culture and the overall use of plastic bottles is reduced.\n\nThrough stakeholder assessment, one on one conversation and surveys, we will assess how to best change the culture at CCA and reduce single use plastic water bottle consumption. We believe that by installing hydration stations and an aggressive campaign that will make the message clear to both faculty and students that single water bottle use should be minimized and encourage the use of refillable water bottles we will be able to change the culture at CCA. By changing the culture at CCA we hope to change the larger culture and inspire other colleges to adopt these practices and create cells of change across the United States.\n', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/fb427f8f-0b54-40d9-a9fc-1737506e9bc3/1/', 'Elizabeth Kukka, Julieta Collart, Kelsey Kamm', 'Spring 2015', 'Sustainability Studio', 'Michael Sammet', 'DSMBA-604-2B', NULL, 0),

They are designed to interrupt the natural process of death and decomposition. Traditional burials involve filling the body with synthetic preservatives and encasing them in wood or steel coffins that are then buried in concrete vaults. Instead of utilizing space for the living, thousands of acres of land are used every year for new cemetery grounds to house the dead.\n\nEach year 800,000 gallons of embalming fluid are used to preserve remains. An average embalming requires a minimum of three gallons of embalming solution. This fluid eventually seeps into our groundwater supplies. 1.6 million tons of concrete is produced each year for burial vaults. Production of concrete is responsible for 5% of the global CO2 footprint. 90,000 tons of steel is used each year for caskets. Steel is one of the most expensive metals to produce in terms of carbon footprint and toxicity (high cost to extract, refine, manufacture). Casket manufacturers are on the EPA’s list of top 50 hazardous material waste producers, primarily as a result of the toxic finishes they apply to their metal caskets. Buried metal caskets will never be reused or recycled. Wood caskets are responsible for the felling of 30 million board feet of wood (mainly tropical and hardwoods). Offsetting the CO2 emissions from the funeral industry EACH YEAR would require half a million acres of forest. Cremation is less damaging, but still far from sustainable - the incineration process emits many noxious substances including dioxin, hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide and climate-changing carbon dioxide. 250,000 tons of CO2 emissions are generated annually from cremations. Each cremation burns 28 gals of fuel and produces 540 lbs of CO2. Cremations are the 3rd largest contributor of airborne mercury contamination (from cremated dental fillings). Approximately 1 million acres of land in the U.S. is being used for cemeteries. Conventional cemeteries generally require large amounts of water, pesticides, and weed killers.\n \nNatural Legacy End of Life Services addresses and solves for the environmental impacts of current burial and cremation services by suggesting natural burial that promises a kind of ‘ecological immortality’ which reflects commitment to collective stewardship of the planet and responsibility for the well-being of future generations. In a natural burial, the body is buried in a shroud of natural materials or a decomposable container, such as a wicker coffin or pine box. At natural burial grounds and hybrid burial grounds, the burial location may be marked with an engraving on natural fieldstone or quarried stone, though conservation burial grounds, where the natural integrity of the land is preserved in its absolute, do not allow permanent markers. Instead, conservation burial sites use a GPS system to locate gravesites, thusly protecting the land in its natural state, while at the same time providing a source of revenue. We propose partnerships with conservation burial sites that are permanently maintained by the conservation organization and kept in perpetuity as a "conservation easement," or land permanently preserved in its natural state.\n\nConnection with the natural process of death also provides many social benefits as well as environmental. Natural Legacy provides a multi touchpoint platform for the end user to customize their own or their loved ones last wishes around commemoration, remembrance and burial services in the most informed and sustainable way. We believe that the greatest opportunity for social impact is done by bringing about a meaningful change in the behavioral response of individuals and how they relate to their understanding of the process of death. Our service empowers users to maximize the social value that can be derived from an improved death preparation experience. We believe that our clients will find that they are able to have much more control over their costs during the process by signing up for our service. Our service also enables the broader community to generate positive externalities from a shift in people''s understanding, perception, and desire for a more sustainable death process.', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/c177c3d4-47de-4db5-904e-6388e5c3fcf4/1/', 'Neha Brahmwar, Julie Grant, Lamin Mansaray', 'Spring 2015', 'Sustainability Studio', 'Michael Sammet', 'DSMBA-604-2A', NULL, 0),

Domesticated nature activities, like caring for plants and gardens also have a positive relationship to adult environment attitudes, but their effects aren’t as strong. Participation in scouts or other forms of environmental education that does not allow for free play in nature did not have an effect on adult attitudes toward the environment. \n\nThe Wild Adventure Bus (preliminary name) provide school kids pre-K to 8th grade with recurring wilderness adventures through an after-school program. The Wild Adventure Bus takes kids to rich natural environments. Age-appropriate activities are incorporated and co-created with the kids, however the focus is on free unstructured play, where kids are encouraged and stimulated to have fun and create self-directed play. \nThe youth-leaders are always at hand, able to assist in problem solving, providing gears and tools, teach skills and building a caring community.

While digital tools have transformed everything\nabout the way we live our lives, the act of writing and sketching to communicate ideas quickly and emotively continues to be a huge part of how we work. But the act of working in both digital and physical mediums means that our ideas end-up scattered across all these mediums. Important nuggets are missed when we sit down to think and create critically because of this lack of unity.\n\nWe designed Sift, a business concept capture in one place all of the pieces one has created in both the digital and physical worlds in one place. Through Sift, we want to introduce a whole new way of thinking and doing that’s natural and true to creative professionals so they can deliver the most thoughtful output possible.\n\nTo communicate the concept behind Sift and its business potential, we created an illustrated business plan in book form.\n\n\n\nHow it Works - With Sift, you take your written thoughts and mail them to us or snap a photo of them.\nWe collect these written inputs into your online Sift account, where we link them to anything you’ve\ncaptured digitally through other services, such as Evernote or Diigo.\n\nThrough the Sift interface, you can then easily sort through all of your ideas and categorize them according\nto project, type of input, or any other system that works for you.

In 1893, a similarly disorganized supply chain led to the development of the large orange grower cooperative, SunKist.

Specifically, we uncovered through \ndozens of interviews with these consumers that they:\n\n1) Save backwards – they spend what they have to and what they want to now, figuring \nthey will save what they have leftover.\n\n2) Find financial check-ins stressful, as they often find that they don’t have as much, if \nanything, left to save once they have finished spending for the short term.\n\n3) Encounter the biggest impulse-spend pitfall while shopping online – it’s tempting and \neasy to click and make a purchase without thinking about longer-term trade-offs.\n\nBuckkit helps address these three issues by facilitating savings goals before spending \nbegins and providing a visual indicator of progress versus those goals within users’ web \nbrowsers:\n\n1) Users first set up their goals for the money that remains after necessities (i.e. rent, \nbills) and automatic long-term savings are paid, designating an amount and a time \nframe for saving toward each goal.  Each user may have a few different goals, for \ninstance saving $400 for 3 months before holiday shopping, $1000 for 6 months for a \nnew laptop, and $1500 for 9 months before a planned trip.  \n\n2) Once their goals are set, users will see an indicator color in their browser toolbars \nwhile shopping online, which tells them whether or not they can afford the item(s) in \ntheir shopping cart while staying on track for their goals.  Green means go ahead – \nyou are budgeted to cover the purchase, Yellow indicates that you are short on funds \nallocated – some money will have to be taken from goals to cover the purchase if you \nchoose to go ahead with it, Red means that all spending money has been used and \nthe purchase will pull entirely from goals if you make it, and Black indicates that the \nonly way to cover the purchase is via credit card debt (all money allocated to both \ngoals and short-term spending has already been used).  By clicking on the indicator, \nusers can see the details behind the color, including their current progress toward \ngoals.\n\nBuckkit provides an empowering way for users to know how their spending will impact their \nsaving goals at the moment of purchase consideration, rather than after the damage has \nbeen done.  It meets Millennials at their pain point of impulsive online spending and instills \na natural self-check that feels helpful without becoming intrusive or shaming.

Many of us are already beginning our journey to success, and full understanding of all types of funding is a must. This project has allowed us to analyse the options out there, understand the nuances in the space, and gain new insight on what we already know.

By providing a family-friendly preventative solution that seamlessly integrates into families'' lives, parents will feel less fear and anxiety in their everyday lives, and in turn, will be able to keep their kids safe while educating them about their allergies at the same time.\n\nAfter parents upload their child’s doctor-administered allergy report to the Oishi Mobile App, a personalized food allergen scanner is mailed to the family. The scanner is programmed with the child’s unique allergy needs and can detect allergens in both packaged and fresh foods. \n\nFor packaged foods, the Oishi scanner can scan barcodes and confirms whether food items come from  manufacturing facilities that are free from cross-contamination on the food production lines based on Oishi''s database containing a list of verified manufacturers. Additionally, through using innovative spectrometer technology, the scanner detects allergens in fresh foods at restaurants and on the go. \n\nParents can purchase multiple scanners for secondary caretakers or simply lend their scanner to anyone who might be taking care of their child. The scanner supports parents in feeling confident that the food they buy is safe for their child.\n\nAlong with the scanner, the Oishi Owl stuffed animal arrives in the mail for their child. When the scanner detects allergens in food, Oishi Owl speaks to the child letting him or her know if the food is safe to eat. Through play and fun, Oishi Owl teaches the child about allergies in a positive way.\n\nLastly, the Oishi mobile app supports families by providing customized recipes based on their child’s unique profile. Specific shopping lists are generated so that parents can keep meals fresh and exciting for the whole family. Additionally, families can connect with other families in the Oishi community to share tips and tricks and ask questions to people they can truly relate to.', 'https://vault.cca.edu/items/e48c1cd3-2882-4cac-830f-38e18e7564dd/1/', 'Liz Comperchio, Chuang-Ming Liu, Rebecca Wolfe, Chris Young', 'Fall 2014', 'Experiences Studio', 'Elizabeth Glenewinkel', 'DSMBA-606-2A', NULL, 0),

Individuals or corporate entities can find it attractive to establish shell subsidiaries or move themselves to areas with reduced or nil taxation levels relative to typical international taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. \n\nIncentives to build a tax haven include money laundering, avoiding paying taxes, creating a front company to conceal activities, hiding assets from the government, keeping your property or investments secret, and opening a bank account in a name other than your own. \n\nOffshore tax havens intrigued our team because several U.S. corporations and other companies around the world have grown in wealth to become larger than countries. \n\nOffshore tax havens are preventing our global economy from considerable growth. There are major flaws in the global financial architecture and the next President of the United States needs to take action concerning this topic. Corporate America is pushing for the United States to move to such a regime to make businesses more competitive against foreign rivals that pay no taxes on overseas earnings.

Over the next 18 months we have outlined benchmarks to take our company to the next stage.\n\nThis will require three core operational foci: Product Pipeline - We will focus on the development and roll out of three products.\nExternal Operations - Client Acquisition will become our top external priority. Within the scope of client acquisition, we will solidify partnership management systems and fine tune marketing activities.\nInternal Operations - Internal operations management must be constantly on the forefront of our minds as we model mindfulness in our own company practices.\n\nThis operations plan provides a framework for Wisdom Labs that will enable us to execute our desired goals with high efficiency.
